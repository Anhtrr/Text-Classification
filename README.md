### ✔️ Compiling/Running Instructions                   
                   

                
- To COMPILE:
                  
                
```
javac textClassifier.java 
```
                    
                  
- Make sure that the 'textClassifier.java ' file is in the same directory as the your specified '{___}.txt' input file ('{___}' means you can name it whatever you want but make sure its .txt extension and specified correctly in the command prompt), make sure that it's content follows the input requirements, as stated in the assignment page. Then, to RUN:
                   
                       
```
java textClassifier.java <corpusFileName> <numOfEntries>
```

This will generate 'Output_{____}.txt' if it doesn't already exist, which contains the program's predictions and results!
